# SAP config

This repo includes the OpenAPI spec and Stainless config for your Stainless project.

Generally you should not need to push directly to this repo and can instead edit these files in the [Stainless Studio](https://app.stainless.com/2flynolye/SAP/studio) or by [automating updates](https://app.stainless.com/docs/guides/automate-updates#automating-updates), though we may occasionally prompt you to write directly to this repo, e.g. if your dev branch has a merge conflict with the main branch.
